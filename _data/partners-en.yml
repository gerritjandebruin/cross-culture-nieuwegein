    StekUp is a social cooperative, started from Cross Culture, where people on benefits can start their own businesses together. How? Thanks to a great place to work, collaboration with others, talent-oriented coaching and the support of experts from the local business community. There is also a charity cycle for the benefit of StekUp itself and Cross Culture! So, you can bring good things to support Cross Culture or become a volunteer in the cycle. The coffee is ready, welcome!

We primarily aim at people who do not know the gospel and who are no longer involved in an existing church.
